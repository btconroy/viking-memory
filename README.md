# Viking Memory

<img style="display: block; margin 5px auto;" src="/public/game-screenshot.png" alt="Viking Memory game" />

A card game where the player must find the matching pair of cards that are face down. Each round you are able to select two cards. If the pair do not match, they are turned back over and the next round begins. 

## Purpose of project

I developed the game to practice using Vue 3 for use in future software projects. Already having some familiarity with React, I was able to pick up on some of the functionality. This was my first step in understanding some of the structure.
